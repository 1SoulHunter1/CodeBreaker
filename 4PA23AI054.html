   <h1>Hello World</h1>
   <p> 
    The Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system and the only known astronomical object to harbor life. It's the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Here are some key points about Earth:

1.<p>**Structure**: The Earth is composed of several layers. The inner core is solid and primarily consists of iron and nickel, while the outer core is molten. Surrounding the core is the mantle, which is semi-solid, and the outermost layer is the Earth's crust.</p>

2.<p>**Atmosphere**: Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with trace amounts of other gases. The atmosphere plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's temperature, protecting life from harmful radiation, and providing the air we breathe.</p>

3. <p>**Hydrosphere**: Earth is often referred to as the "Blue Planet" because of its abundant water, covering about 71% of its surface. This water exists in various forms, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and glaciers, and it's essential for supporting life as we know it.</p>

4. <p>**Geography**: Earth's surface features diverse landscapes, including mountains, valleys, plains, deserts, and forests. These features are shaped by geological processes such as plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanic activity.</p>

5. <p>**Life**: Earth is the only known planet where life exists. The presence of liquid water, a suitable atmosphere, and a moderate climate have allowed for the proliferation of diverse forms of life, ranging from microorganisms to complex organisms like plants, animals, and humans.</p>

6. <p>**Orbit and Rotation**: Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, creating the concept of a year. It also rotates on its axis, completing one full rotation approximately every 24 hours, which gives us the cycle of day and night.</p>

7. <p>**Magnetosphere**: Earth has a magnetic field generated by the motion of molten iron in its outer core. This magnetic field extends into space and helps shield the planet from harmful solar radiation, creating the magnetosphere.</p>

Understanding Earth's characteristics and processes is vital for various scientific disciplines, including geology, meteorology, biology, and environmental science. Additionally, it's the only home for humanity and countless other species, emphasizing the importance of studying and preserving our planet.</p>
